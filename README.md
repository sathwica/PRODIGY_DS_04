Task 4: Email Spam Classifier

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. In Task 4, I built a Spam Classification Model that identifies whether an email is spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques.

🔍 Project Overview

-> Preprocessed and cleaned email text data
-> Performed tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization
-> Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
-> Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
-> Selected the best-performing model for deployment-ready results

🧠 Tech Stack

-> Python
-> Pandas, NumPy
-> Scikit-learn
-> NLTK
-> Matplotlib / Seaborn

📈 Outcome

The final model accurately classifies spam emails with high precision and recall, demonstrating effective text classification and ML workflow skills.
